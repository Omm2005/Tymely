## üëÄ What is this?

Tymely is an AI powered planner that can help you to create you own plan for your next idea/goal! Ever got stuck while learning by yourself and wished if there was a path/roadmap! I got you bro!
For now it's just a small app but I'll add features that will help you.


## How do I use this?

Just go to [Tymely.vercel.app](https://tymely.vercel.app) and sign in with your google account.
1. Go to the workflow page to start with your goal
2. Add a new workflow where you will define your deadline and your goal.
