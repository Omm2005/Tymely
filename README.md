## üëÄ What is this?

Build your own second brain with supermemory. It's a ChatGPT for your bookmarks. Import tweets or save websites and content using the [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/supermemory/afpgkkipfdpeaflnpoaffkcankadgjfc?hl=en-GB&authuser=0) (the extension on webstore is not updated, please use the one in the repo)

Well, here's the thing - me and @yxshv save a _lot_ of content on the internet.

Twitter bookmarks, websites, snippets, etc.

But we never look back to it - to us, it's like throwing information in the void.

Supermemory fixes this.

## How do I use this?

Just go to [supermemory.dhr.wtf](https://supermemory.dhr.wtf) and sign in with your google account.

To use the chrome extension,

1. Get the chrome ext (click on the button)
2. Click on the "Extension Auth" button so the extension knows who you are :)
